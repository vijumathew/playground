2. navigate to [[file:public/index.html][index.html]] in a browser
3. in the cider-repl buffer execute
  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (shadow/watch :app)
  (shadow/repl :app)
  #+END_SRC

5. now the repl is connected to the browser window - test this with
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  (js/alert "connected!")
  #+END_SRC
